                <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
                <p>I don't know what the Lord has for me in his plans, but I have a few career and ideas for my future. I would like to have a career in law enforcement, particularly in espionage, whether that be cybersecuruty or a government agency. I love the idea of being able to protect those around me, to have the ability to help. This will require a few schooling options, particularly a baisic degree in Law Enforcement and possibly cybersecurity, as well as going through a police or government-sanctioned academy. I don't know when or how I will retire, but I do plan to stay in the workforce for several years. </p>
