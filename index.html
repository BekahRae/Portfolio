           <h1>Who am I?</h1>
               <p>As a young person in today's world, I believe that I influence my surroundings, not the other way around. It is up to me and my peers to create the world we want for future generations. </p>

               <p>  One of the most important things to me is my family. They always come first, no matter the situation. I have two loving parents and two amazing siblings, along with DOZENS of aunts, uncles, and cousins. We love nothing more than to get together and play fun games, eat amazing food, and retell hilarious stories. As for hobbies, I really enjoy practicing art. I also LOVE the outdoors. God has a wonderful sense of creativity, and I believe that manifests itself in the beauty of the world around us.</p>
               <P> One thing I think you should know about me is my passion for helping people. No matter where I end up in life, it is my ultimate goal to love those around me. I love serving, and I believe that it should be my goal to improve my environment around me. As it says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A23-24&version=ESV">Colossians 3:23-24</a>.</P>
