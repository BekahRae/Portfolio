               <h2>My Motivation</h2>
               <p>As a young person in today's world, I have seen plenty of examples of people my age who are wildly unprepared for life beyond high school. They have no experience, and the brutality of adult life comes as a big shock to them. It's been my goal, after seeing that, to gain as much insight and prepare as much as I can, so that I'm well equipped to support myself and deal with the new challenges that come my way. I've gone about this in a few different ways, some of which are my job experience and college preparation. Below, you'll see some of my efforts and accomplishments that I have aqquired thus far.</p>
